    <p id="Intro">Hello! This is Ronald Allan C. Gonzales (8-A) and this is my computer project for the 4th quarter. This webpage was purely built on HTML & CSS. Some features will not work because some of them require Javascript which is an area I am not experienced in. This webpage can serve as a blog for my personal life and a way to express how much I've learned in both HTML & CSS.</p>

    <p id="AboutMe">"I may have ADHD (Self-diagnosed) simply because I change my hobbies and interest fast. I love the increase in dopamine and exploring places that aren't in my comfort zone and have learned many skills along the way. This webpage is one of them. The following cards/columns explain more about me." </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Ego"><div id="Ego">I have a massive ego. Think of my ego as the height of Mount Everest and my actual intelligence as the size of a regular McDonald's happy meal toy. Get the point? I am confident in being not confident and not confident in being confident. I studied various skills and each time I would feel like a genius only to be met by the reality that I am in fact not a genius. "I am not depressed, I'm just a genius" - Me probably, </div> </div>
    <div class="Academics"><div id="Academics">I can say that in terms of academics I don't lack behind. Although my productivity isn't exactly admirable... I am confident in my ability in many areas and some I am not confident. More logical subjects such as science & math are my strength but subjects like filipino & arabic were my weakest. </div> </div>
    <div class="Relationships"><div id="Relationships">I am very alone. I mean I have friends outside and inside of school, I also have a family but in terms of relationship to the opposite gender, I am very much alone... I mean who needs companionship... Haha.... *sobs*</div> </div>

     <p id="FooterText">The sources and tutorial for how I accomplished each effect is on the source page in the top navigator. Simply click on it and it should redirect you to the page. T/W I used Opera as my live server to see how it would look. If some alignments are not right than it may be the result of incompatibility from other browsers and if the audio were to not autoplay. It should be visible near the end (I couldn't find a fix for it. sorry)</p>
